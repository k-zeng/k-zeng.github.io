# About Me

### My Current Studies and Interests
Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison under the advisement of Prof. Michael D. Graham studying the application of deep reinforcement learning and deep reduced-order systems modeling towards chaotic dynamical systems and flows to learn efficient flow control strategies from data. I am passionate about combining dynamical systems theory to inform and guide the design of data-driven deep frameworks and I am especially interested in the intersection between unsupervised & semisupervised learning methods, system/data symmetries, minimal representations/dynamics. Besides my current studies I am also interested in the use of data-driven methods for rapid materials discovery and materials property modeling. 

### Past Research Experiences and Education
I obtained my Bachelors degree in Chemical Engineering and minor in Chemistry from the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities. Here I worked under the advisement of Prof. Samira Azarin on the dip coating process of aluminum disks with PCL polymer for biocompatibility as well as the fabrication of biocompatible microporous polymer scaffolds. Together these were combined towards a non-invasive focal hyperthermia tool in the ablation of metastatic cancer cells. Concurrently, I also worked in the Zhao lab at the University of North Dakota in studying the fluorescence quenching 
ability of graphene oxide using a rigid silica spacer shell as a potential model system for graphene oxide based fluorescence sensing systems.
